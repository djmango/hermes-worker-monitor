# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Fork of hermes-monitor v0.2.2 (MIT, mr-3mm3), worker health only.
- Renamed to hermes-worker-monitor, with its own plugin.yaml, manifest, and desktop plugin id.
- Removed the Quotas footer item, the provider fan-out, the DeepSeek key lookup and balance call, the Anthropic OAuth refresh path, and the internal-function clone.
- The backend now has one route, `GET /workers`, and the module reads no credentials and makes no network calls.
- Trimmed the test suite to the worker tests, plus a guard test that fails if a credential or network reference returns to the backend module.
